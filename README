            Hello all,

                 I  am  pleased to release this version 1.0.1 of Ptrash.
            Ptrash is a small console based utility program.  Ptrash  is
            intended  to  move  file(s)  to  ~/.trash.  Where,  trash is
            nothing but a ’~/.trash’ directory under home directory of a
            user.   Ptrash  facilitates  moving of all types of files to
            trash, as well as restoring those files  and/or  directories
            to their original location.

                 I  took  upon  writing Ptrash, when I deleted(using rm)
            few files and found my self badly desperate to retrieve them
            back, but just could not do so.


            Installation:

            Installing  Ptrash  is  quite  easy and straight forward, do
            ’cd’ to the directory (ptrash-1.0.1) containing all  sources
            and follow these steps...

                 $ ./configure
                 $ make
                 # make install

            That’s  all, you have Ptrash installed. For more information
            about usage and general options try...

                 $ ptrash --help
                 $ man ptrash
                 $ info ptrash


            Problems:

            Please  send  any  bug  reports/problems  to  <pj.pandit  at
            yahoo.co.in>.  While  doing  so  do  include  "ptrash-1.0.1"
            string in subject  line  and  also  describe  precisely  the
            behaviour  of  ptrash.  Sending actual command, which caused
            that behaviour would be even more helpful while debugging.

            Thank you!
