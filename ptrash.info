1 Overview
**********

1.1 Introduction
================

     `ptrash' is a console based simple utility to move named file(s) to
~/.trash directory. In case the ~/.trash directory is non-existent,
`ptrash' creates it for you and then moves the file(s) to this
directory.  By default `ptrash' runs in non-interactive mode. That
means it does not ask user if she is sure to move a file to ~/.trash
even when the named file already exists in ~/.trash and proceeds with
overwriting that file.

1.2 How it evolved
==================

     `ptrash' is a console based simple application. I took upon
writing this, when I deleted(using rm) few files and found myself badly
desperate to retrieve them back, but just could not do so.

     So, I wrote a program named `ptrash' which moved regular files from
current directory to ~/.trash, that's all. Then I thought `ptrash'
should do some more things such as movement of whole directory, restore
an already moved file from ~/.trash to its original location, etc. And
now this version of `ptrash' does all of these tasks; plus, facilitates
moving of block and character special device files and fifo files as
well.

2 Invoking ptrash
*****************

     `ptrash' can be invoked by a simple command as

     Usage: ptrash [OPTIONS] file-name-1 [file-name-2 ...]

     As of now `ptrash' supports the following set of options

`-d'
`--delete'
     delete named file(s) from ~/.trash. Do not use this option with -r
     or -restore option

`-i'
     Enables an interactive mode of operation; thus letting user to
     decide if she want to overwrite OR delete an existing file or not.

`-r'
`--restore'
     Restore a file from trash to its original location. Do not use
     this option with -d or -delete option above

`-h'
`--help'
     shows small help on the console

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Turn on verbose operation mode

`-V'
`--version'
     shows version information

2.1 Example:
============

`$ ptrash readme.txt'
     move the file `readme.txt' to ~/.trash directory

`$ ptrash -v readme.txt install report.doc tar1.tgz'
     This moves all the named files to ~/.trash directory with verbose
     mode of operation enabled, that causes ptrash to show file name
     and progress bar as it is moved

`$ ptrash -r readme.txt tar1.tgz'
     This will cause ptrash to restore files `readme.txt' and
     `tar1.tgz' to their respective original location.

`$ ptrash -d install.txt minutes.txt'
     This will delete `install.txt' and `minutes.txt' from trash
     directory.

`$ ptrash -drv todo.txt'
     This'll result in an error message, as option -d and -r are not
     ment to be used together.
